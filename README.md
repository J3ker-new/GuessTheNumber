# Number Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game written in Java where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or getting closer to the target number.

## Features

- "You're getting closer!"
- "You're far off!"
- "You're SUPER close!!"

### Restart/End Prompt on Win.
