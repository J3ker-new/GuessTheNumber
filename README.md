##Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game written in Java where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or getting closer to the target number.<br>

##Features
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 0 and 100.<br>
Feedback on Guesses: The game gives feedback on how close the guess is to the target number.<br>
Proximity-based Hints: Based on how far the guess is, hints are provided (e.g., "You're getting closer!", "You're far off!", etc.).<br>
Termination on Win: The game automatically ends when the correct number is guessed.<br>
Recursion: The game uses recursion to allow multiple guesses until the correct number is found.<br>
Input Validation: The user is prompted to ensure that their guesses are within the valid range (0â€“100).<br>
##Requirements
Java 8 or later (for both the console and GUI version).<br>
